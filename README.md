📌 Automated PCB Defect Detection Using Statistical Image Analysis
---

-------------
📖 Overview
---
This project focuses on automated detection of defects in Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) using statistical image analysis techniques. Image preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning models are used to classify PCB images as defective or non-defective.

-----------
🎯 Key Features
------
1. Image preprocessing and noise reduction
2. Edge detection and contour analysis
3. Statistical texture feature extraction
4. Machine learning-based defect classification
5. Visualization of detected defects
